### Introduction

Hey I'm an individual. I play football, basketball, and track. I placed third in the 2025 Longjump, played varsity for football, and JV all as a freshman. I'm a child of God and do my best to do everything in his name, and not do anything out of sin or desire. Yet, I'm still a human and a sinner. I will make mistakes. But I'm not ashamed to say that I can be better and will be better.

I'm a fan of jazz, rap, and cultural music. I don't really like metal, pop, or throat singing. I grew up in a household full of music and memorized almost all of the songs on that playlist. Completely unrelated, I'm a gamer too. I play Fortnite, 2K, Marvel Rivals, and Palworld. I'm pretty competitive regardless of the context. I'm a big fan of fried chicken, sushi, spam masubi, and breakfast croissant sandwiches.

I hate hypocrites.
